SO(3) Riemannian Optimization for Pose Graph Optimization.

Abstract--- 
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of verification techniques for Pose Graph Optimization (PGO). Leveraging the foundational SE-Sync algorithm, we develop custom algorithm implementations and tests for an in-depth evaluation. The PGO problem is transformed into a relaxed Semidefinite Programming (SDP) problem to obtain a quality certificate. From the relaxed SDP solution, we derive a feasible PGO solution. In many practical cases, the relaxed and original problems share the same optimal value, resulting in a quality certificate with tight bounds. However, understanding the limitations of SDP relaxations is crucial. We design custom tests with non-tight bounds to assess the performance of different algorithms. Our main contribution is the exploration of an alternative approach based on Riemannian optimization over a product of SO\left(3\right) manifolds. When certificate bounds are not tight, this method generally produces superior PGO solutions.
